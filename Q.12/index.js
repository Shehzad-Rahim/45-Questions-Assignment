// Question no 12
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var myFriends = ['Wasif', 'Rafay', 'Usman', 'Madiha', 'Iqra', 'Alishba', 'Ayesha'];
myFriends.forEach(function (name) { return console.log("Hello ".concat(name, " I want you to join my team for teamwork and future projects of web development")); });
