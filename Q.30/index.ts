// Question 30 

// Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:

let usernames:string[] = ['Wasif', 'Rafay', 'Usman', 'Madiha', 'Iqra', 'admin'];

usernames.forEach(user => console.log(`Hello ${user}, Welcome back to my website`)
)
